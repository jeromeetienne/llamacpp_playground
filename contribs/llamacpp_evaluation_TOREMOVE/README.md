# Experimentation evaluating llamacpp

## Goals
- [ ] Compare the performance of llamacpp models
  - thus people can choose the best model for their use case
- [ ] do it with 2 technologies: natively node-llama-cpp and langchain.js
  - langchain.js support for llamacpp is not perfect, but it is so rich
- [ ] What are the limits of langchain.js's support for llamacpp

## Langchain.js support status
- langchain's LLamaCpp doesn't support grammar
  - the json grammar is a **KEY** feature of llamacpp, improving quality of structured output
  - **NOTE** Q. could we improve langchain support ? it got the concept in [DynamicStructuredTool](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/structured_chat)
- langchain's LLamaCpp doesn't support chat-model

## How to get started

Install the dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

## How to test

It test all .json files are conforming to their json-schema.

```sh
npm test
```

## How to Download Models ?
see [llamacpp_playground README.md](../../README.md)

## How to Generate a dataset ?

This is done by ```synthetic_data_generator.js``` tool
```sh
./bin/synthetic_data_generator.js 
```

Here is the inline help for this tool
```
Usage: dataset_generator.js [options] [command]

dataset_generator.js

Options:
  -V, --version               output the version number
  -h, --help                  display help for command

Commands:
  dataset_basicQa             generate the dataset for a personality
  dataset_translateFrench     generate the dataset for a personality
  dataset_stateUnionQa        generate the dataset for a personality
  gridsearch_translateFrench  generate the hptuning.json+.gridsearch.json for translateFrench
  gridsearch_onlyBlah         generate the hptuning.json+.gridsearch.json for onlyBlah
  gridsearch_testAccuracy     generate the hptuning.json+.gridsearch.json for testAccuracy
  help [command]              display help for command
```


## How to do an Evaluation ? (with hyper parameter tuning)

Create an evaluation
```sh
./bin/llamacpp_evaluation.js create translareFrenchEval ./data/datasets/translateFrench.dataset.json ./data/hptunings/gridsearch_translateFrench.hptuning.json
```

Compute the evaluation

```sh
./bin/llamacpp_evaluation.js compute translareFrenchEval 
```

Display the evaluation report

```sh
./bin/llamacpp_evaluation.js report translareFrenchEval 
```

Once you don't need it anymore, you can delete the evaluation

```sh
./bin/llamacpp_evaluation.js delete translareFrenchEval 
```


## How to do hyper parameter tuning

All the evaluation steps can be a drag to do manually. So we can use the hyper parameter tuning feature to do it for us.
It will perform a grid search on the hyper parameters and do the evaluation for us.

One can tune the 
- modelName : the model to use (it can be a langchain.js model or a node-llama-cpp model)
- systemPrompt : the instruction to the model
- userPrompt : the question to the model

```sh
node ./bin/llamacpp-evaluation.js hptuning myEval ./data/evaluations/hptunings/superHpTuning.hptuning.json5
```

- [Sample .hptuning.json5 file](./data/evaluations/hptunings/superHpTuning.hptuning.json5)
## Evaluation Steps (manual without hyper tuning)

When doing a evaluation, multiples steps are needed

### 1. generate dataset
See "How to Generate a dataset ?" section
### 2. do a prediction on this dataset

```
node ./bin/llamacpp-evaluation.js predict myEval myPredict
```

- ```-l``` or ```--langchain``` to use langchain.js
- ```-d``` or ```--direct``` to use node-llama-cpp

### 3. evaluate this prediction

```sh
node ./bin/llamacpp-evaluation.js evaluate myEval myPredict
```

### 4. display a report comparing all predictions

```sh
node ./bin/llamacpp-evaluation.js report myEval
```
